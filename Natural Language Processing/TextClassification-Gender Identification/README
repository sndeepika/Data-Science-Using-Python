In a famous paper, Campbell, Gentile, and Twenge found that men and women authors could be distinguished by the frequency they used pronouns. The claim was that women used more pronouns.
I tested this claim using novels from Project Gutenberg.
My program accepts five novels each written by men and five by women and compute the frequency of pronoun use in each
book, and then for each group of five books. 
Program prints the fraction of pronouns used by men and women.
Our claim is true.
